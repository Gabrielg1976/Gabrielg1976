## 💡 My Approach to Prompt Engineering

Coming from a background in quality control and process optimization, I apply the same rigorous methodologies to prompt engineering:

1. **Systematic Testing** - Every prompt is tested across multiple scenarios and edge cases
2. **Iterative Refinement** - Document what works, what doesn't, and why
3. **Quality Metrics** - Measure performance objectively with clear success criteria
4. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Every prompt includes context, methodology, and results
5. **Domain Expertise** - Leverage real-world experience to create prompts that solve actual problems
